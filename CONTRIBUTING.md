# Contributing

This document briefly describes how to contribute to the [BioContainers project](https://github.com/BioContainers/specs).

## Before you Begin

If you have an idea for a feature/container to add or an approach for a bugfix, it is best to communicate with BioContainers developers early. The most
common venues for this are [GitHub issues](https://github.com/BioContainers/specs/issues) for common specification issues and the
[Containers and Tools](https://github.com/BioContainers/containers/issues) for container/docker related issues.
Browse through existing GitHub issues and if one seems related, comment on it. If no existing issue seems appropriate, a new issue can be
opened using [this form](https://github.com/BioContainers/BioContainers/issues/new). BioContainers developers are also generally available via BioContainerss@gmail.com or 
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/biocontainers/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/biocontainers/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## How to Contribute

* All changes to the [specifications BioContainers project](https://github.com/BioContainers/bidocker)
  should be made through pull requests to this repository (with just two
  exceptions outlined below).

* If you are new to Git, the [Try Git](http://try.github.com/) tutorial is a good places to start.
  More learning resources are listed at https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/ .

* Make sure you have a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

* Fork the [container repository](https://github.com/BioContainers/containers) on
  GitHub to make your changes. (While many Containers instances track active development
  happens in the containers GitHub repository and this is where pull requests
  should be made).

* Choose the correct branch to develop your changes against.

  * Additions of new features to the code base should be pushed to the `dev` branch (`git
    checkout dev`).

  * Most bug fixes to previously release components (things in bidocker-dist)
    should be made against the recent `release_XX.XX` branch (`git checkout release_XX.XX`).

  * Serious security problems should not be fixed via pull request - please
    responsibly disclose these by e-mailing them (with or without patches) to
    biodockers@gmail.com . The BioContainers core development team will solve
    those issues and we will provide you credit for the discovery when publicly
    disclosing the issue.

* If your changes modify containers/images - please ensure the resulting files
  conform to BioContainers Specifications [BioContainers
  Specifications](http://biocontainers.pro/docs/developer-manual/biocotainers-dockerfile/).

* Commit and push your changes to your
  [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/).

* Open a [pull
  request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
  with these changes. You pull request message ideally should include:

   * A description of why the changes should be made.

   * A description of the implementation of the changes.

   * A description of how to test the changes.

* The pull request should pass all the continuous integration tests which are
  automatically run by GitHub using e.g. Travis CI.

## Ideas

BioContainers's [BioContainers Specification and Design](http://github.com/BioContainers/BioContainers/issues) is filled with comments and ideas
for enhancements and we believe would make the best entry points for new developers.

## A Quick Note about Containers

  For the most part, BioContainers containers should be published to the [BioContainers containers](https://github.com/BioContainers/BioContainers) and not in this repository directly. 
  If you are looking to supply new containers first check if an existing container exists in this repository [BioContainers containers](https://github.com/BioContainers/BioContainers) -
  please checkout the repository on GitHub.

## Handling Pull Requests

Everyone is encouraged to express opinions and issue non-binding votes on pull
requests, but only members of the *contributors* group may issue binding votes
on pull requests. 

Votes on pull requests should take the form of
[+1, 0, -1, and fractions](http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html)
as outlined by the Apache Foundation.

Pull requests modifying pre-existing releases should be restricted to bug fixes
and require at least 2 *+1* binding votes from someone other than the author of
the pull request with no *-1* binding votes.

Pull requests changing or clarifying the procedures governing this repository:

- Must be made to the ``dev`` branch of this repository.
- Must remain open for at least 192 hours (unless every qualified committer has
  voted).
- Require binding *+1* votes from at least 25% of qualified *committers* with no
  *-1* binding votes.
- Should be titled with the prefix *[PROCEDURES]* and tagged with
  the *procedures* tag in Github.
- Should not be modified once open. If changes are needed, the pull request
  should be closed, re-opened with modifications, and votes reset.
- Should be restricted to just modifying the procedures and generally should not
  contain code modifications.
- If the pull request adds or removes committers, there must be a separate
  pull request for each person added or removed.

Any other pull request requires at least 1 *+1* binding vote from someone other
than the author of the pull request. A member of the committers group merging a
pull request is considered an implicit +1.

Pull requests marked *[WIP]* (i.e. work in progress) in the title by the
author(s), or tagged WIP via GitHub tags, may *not* be merged without
coordinating the removal of that tag with the pull request author(s), and
completing the removal of that tag from wherever it is present in the open pull
request.

### Timelines

Except in the case of pull requests modifying governance procedures, there are
generally no objective guidelines defining how long pull requests must remain
open for comment. Subjectively speaking though - larger and more potentially
controversial pull requests containing enhancements should remain open for a at
least a few days to give everyone the opportunity to weigh in.

### Vetoes

A note on vetoes (*-1* votes) taken verbatim from the
[Apache Foundation](http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html):

>"A code-modification proposal may be stopped dead in its tracks by a -1 vote
by a qualified voter. This constitutes a veto, and it cannot be overruled nor
overridden by anyone. Vetoes stand until and unless withdrawn by their casters.
>
>To prevent vetoes from being used capriciously, they must be accompanied by a
technical justification showing why the change is bad (opens a security
exposure, negatively affects performance, etc. ). A veto without a
justification is invalid and has no weight."

For votes regarding non-coding issues such as procedure changes, the requirement
that a veto is accompanied by a *technical* justification is relaxed somewhat,
though a well reasoned justification must still be included.

### Reversions

A *-1* vote on any recently merged pull request requires an immediate
reversion of the merged pull request. The backout of such a pull request
invokes a mandatory, minimum 72 hour, review period.

- Recently merged pull requests are defined as a being within the past 168 hours (7
  days), so as to not prevent forward progress, while allowing for reversions of
  things merged without proper review and consensus.
- The person issuing the -1 vote will, upon commenting `-1` with technical
  justification per the vetoes section, immediately open a pull request to
  revert the original merge in question. If any committer other than the -1
  issuer deems the justification technical - regardless of whether they agree
  with justification - that committer must then merge the pull request to
  revert.

### Direct Commit Access

The BioContainers *committers* group may only commit directly to BioContainers (i.e.  outside
of a pull request and not following the procedures described here) the
following two categories of patches:

* Patches for serious security vulnerabilities.
* Cherry-picking and/or merging of existing approved commits to other 
branches.
